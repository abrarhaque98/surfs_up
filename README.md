# Surfs Up Analysis

### Overview of Analysis
In this project the objective was to provide weather analysis to an investor of a Hawaii Surf and Shake Shop. The investors concern is that weather conditions may hinder the performance of the shop and eventually lead to failure. To provide more knowledge to the investor, queries are performed ona SQLite database containing weather information for the Island of Oahu from several years. Temperatures for the months of June and December are queried for and presented to the investor to show temperature viability for the business. 

### Results

The results for the queries are as shown below.

* Overall it can be seen that December is on average slightly chillier by almost 4 degrees in every quartile. 
* One concern can be the minimum temperatures on what is acceptable weather to visit, Decembers minimum temperature was 56 degrees while Junes was 64. 
* The data did not have an equivalent count of temperature data suggesting that December could have more temperature points swinging it in either direction whether it be warmer or colder.

### Summary

The results yielded information suggesting that December's temperatures are not drastically different compared to June's differing by only 4 degree's and the difference in the temperatures effect on the investors decision is up to his discretion. Additional queries that could be done for the investor would be one measuring precipitation for the months of June and December. 

The suggested queries would appear as below.

These two queries allow more information to be extracted from the Database regarding the weather in the months of June and December.

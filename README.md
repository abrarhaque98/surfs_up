# Surfs Up Analysis

### Overview of Analysis
In this project the objective was to provide weather analysis to an investor of a Hawaii Surf and Shake Shop. The investors concern is that weather conditions may hinder the performance of the shop and eventually lead to failure. To provide more knowledge to the investor, queries are performed ona SQLite database containing weather information for the Island of Oahu from several years. Temperatures for the months of June and December are queried for and presented to the investor to show temperature viability for the business. 

### Results
